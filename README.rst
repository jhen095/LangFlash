LangFlash - Simple Japanese Flash Cards
================

**A simple flash card program created to scratch 3 needs I had. 
1. Quickly, easily and customizably create my own Japanese flash cards to help me memorize vocab for JLTP N5. 
2. Learn Python. 
3. Learn Git.

Toward that end there are about 100 verbs and 100 adjectives that can be learnt from LangFlash.**
